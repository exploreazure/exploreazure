### Hi there 👋

I enjoy learning new things within Microsoft Azure. I especially like to automate tasks to prevent repetitive work. 

- 🌱 I am currently learning Bicep - Finding the syntax much easier, to understand and read, when compared to JSON templates. 
- 💰 See my certifications on https://www.credly.com/users/barry-sharpen/badges
- 🔭 I’m currently working with AKS
