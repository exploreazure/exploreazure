### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy learning new things within Microsoft Azure. I especially like to automate tasks to prevent repetitive work. 

- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning Bicep - Finding the syntax much easier, to understand and read, when compared to JSON templates. 
- ðŸ’° See my certifications on https://www.credly.com/users/barry-sharpen/badges
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with AKS
